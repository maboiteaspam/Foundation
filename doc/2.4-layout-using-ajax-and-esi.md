## Working with ajax / esi

Nowadays there is no serious php application which does not consume
a system to implement FPC caching, via proxy or internal implementation.

C makes no exception to that.

C goes beyond and provides two action keywords `ajaxify` & `esify`
to embrace `cache punch hole` techniques provided
to enhance the speed, scalability, and hosting of our applications.


`ajaxify` keyword to ajaxify the given block id.

It takes an array such [id=> block to ajaxify]

```yml
structure:
    [block_id]: # you must first declare the block to ajaxify it
      set_template: Module:/some/path.ext
  - ajaxify: # then apply a layout structure change
      id: [block_id]
  # You should also ensure to register jquery.
  # That's it !
```

`esify` keyword to esify the given block id.

It takes an array such [id=> block to esify]

```yml
structure:
    [block_id]: # you must first declare the block to esifyc
      set_template: Module:/some/path.ext
  - esify: # then apply a layout structure change
      id: [block_id]
  # esi does not need any other dependencies
  # other than an esi-able front proxy
  # That's it !
```
