## Working with Validation

The C framework provides you the ability to validate forms.

Validation is based on ajax, and thus requires javascript.

Validation relies on `constraint` applied onto form objects, and submitted data.

With the help of those two structure the validation framework
is able to give you back an helpful JSON object
describing errors to inject into the view after it handled a form submit.

#### Available constraints

You can find a complete list of base constraint by referring to symfony/silex documentation available here

- http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html#basic-constraints

- http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html#form-validation

- http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/validator.html#validating-objects

#### Demo-ing constraints

To demonstrate `constraints`, let s create a working example.

To create a working demo of form validation we should have 3 files,

- a `layout` file

    To describe the page, have a base structure, inject the form and the view.

- a `form` file

    To describe the form for this demonstration

- a `view` file

    To display, render and manage form submission.

- We will also need a `controller` to submit the form

    `Welcome::form` controller knows how to submit a `form` from a `layout`, it will be used automatically.


#### Demo in action

Let s now create a regular layout importing `HTML:/1-column.php` and defining required `assets`.

__Layout file__: src/layouts/formDemo.yml
```yml

# Defines and chane the structure of the layout.
structure:

  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml
  - import: jQuery:/register.yml
  - import: Form:/register.yml

    body_content:
      set_template: Welcome:/formDemo.php
      require:
        - jquery:2.x || 1.x
        - js-normalizer:1.x # this lib will help to normalize javascript capabilities
        - form-helper:1.x  # this lib will help to manage errors display and ajax validation.

      import_form:
        as: myForm # It is the name of the variable used into the view
        from: Welcome:/demoForm.yml

```


__Form file__: src/forms/demoForm.yml
```yml

name: myForm
attr:
  id: myForm

children:

  name:
    type: text
    validation:                     # It s the key to register constraints.
      - NotBlank: ~                 # It s a constraint to forbid blank values.
    options:
      label: Your name
      data: John

  email:
    type: email
    validation:
      - Email: ~
    options: {label: "Your email", data: "some"}

  subscribe:
    type: submit
    options:
      label: subscribe
```

__View file__: src/layouts/formDemo.php
```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
/* @var $myForm \Symfony\Component\Form\FormView This is the form object to render. */
?>

<h1>Form demonstration</h1>

<?php
echo $this->form_start($myForm);
echo $this->form_rows($myForm);
echo $this->form_end($myForm);
?>

<?php $this->inlineTo('last'); ?>
<script>
    (function () {
        var form = $("#myForm");
        form.ajaxForm({
            dataType: 'json',
            success: window.CHelpers.formErrorProcessor(form)
        });
        form.on('reset', function () {
            form.find('.errors').remove()
        })
    })();
</script>
<?php $this->endInline(); ?>

<br/>
```
