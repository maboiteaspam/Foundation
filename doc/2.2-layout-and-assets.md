## Working with assets

Assets are fundamentals within web applications.

C framework gives you the ability
to work with them by `semver require` injection,
instead of embed definition.

For inline asset composition which are defined within the view,
C framework gives you the ability
to defines their position into the document.

Those methods should help to ease integration and management
of assets within the context of a scaled application.

Hello the world about assets example looks likes

__File:__ src/layouts/hello-the-world-in-ajax.yml

```yml
# provide information about the layout to be rendered
meta:
    id: hello-the-world
    description: Hello the world written with a layout

# describe and update the structure of the layout
structure:

  # Import a base layout
  # It will inject numerous blocks
  # to manage assets
  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml

  # register an asset reference on the layout
  # the later a block can require it with
  # require: [jquery:2.x]
  - register_assets:
      alias: jquery
      path: jQuery:/jquery-2.1.3.min.js
      version: 2.1.3
      target: page_footer_js
      first: true

    # select body_content node of the layout
    # body_content was delared by HTML:/1-column.yml
    body_content:
      # set its body
      body: |
          Hello the world !
    # ajaxify will render the block using ajax
    # and also inject jquery,
    # if it is available on the layout !
    ajaxify:
      id: body_content

  # Always good stuff

#### HTML:/1-column: A base layout

https://github.com/maboiteaspam/Foundation/blob/master/src/C/ModernApp/HTML/layouts/1-column.yml

##### Vendor assets

To define vendor and load vendor asset
C framework suggest to make use of `register.yml`
per vendor.

Let s see how `jQuery` is provided within the system.

It provides a layout file, dedicated to jQuery vendor asset
definition and loading via `register_assets` keyword.

__File:__ https://github.com/maboiteaspam/Foundation/tree/master/src/C/ModernApp/jQuery/layouts/register.yml

```yml
# Register jQuery on the layout
structure:

  # register_assets adds an asset reference on the layout object
  - register_assets:
      alias: jquery # it s the public alias consumed by module requiring this asset
      path: jQuery:/jquery-2.1.3.min.js # it s the path of the assets, can be array
      version: 2.1.3 # it s the version of this asset, it lets module require their own version
      target: page_footer_js # it s te layout target asset block to inject the asset into
      first: true # preferably first asset, it s not guaranteed ! but does the job so far.
      satisfy: # this is a list of well require constraints that this asset can satisfy
      # its mainly for performance purpose
        - "2.x || 1.x"
  # now register jquery for non html5 browsers,
  # the system will implement a strategy to select appropriate resource.
  - register_assets:
      alias: jquery
      path: jQuery:/jquery-1.11.3.min.js
      version: 1.11.3
      target: page_footer_js
      first: true
      satisfy:
        - "2.x || 1.x"
```

__To consume__ those asset you can now simply import it,

__File:__ src/layouts/hello-the-world-in-ajax.yml

```yml
structure:

  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml
  - import: jQuery:/register.yml

    body_content:
      body: |
          Hello the world !

    # ajaxify will inject jquery via reauire constraint
    # require: jquery:2.x || 1.x
    ajaxify:
      id: body_content

```

### Action keywords
