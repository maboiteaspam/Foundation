## Working with templates

Templates are the implementation files of each block's' view.

They are located under `src/templates/`,
they use `plain php` as templating engine
and receives `plain php object` as data.

Views are provided an useful context helper to
realize most common display actions.

A view example is

__File:__ src/templates/hello-the-world.php
```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
?>
<h1><?php echo $this->upper($this->trans("welcome")); ?></h1>

<?php $this->display('configurable_block_id'); ?>
```

__Tips__
Don't forget to use php comments to qualify `$this` variable.

Doing so helps your IDE to provide more pertinent information!

```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
?>
... put the content here
```

### Injectable blocks

It s useful pattern to use when you want to inject blocks into a template.

The principle is very simple, use a data variable as block name.

__File:__ src/templates/injected-block.php
```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
/* @var $injected_block_id string The block to inject. */
?>
<h1><?php echo $this->upper($this->trans("welcome")); ?></h1>

<?php $this->display(<?php $injected_block_id; ?>); ?>
```

Later, within the layout definition file,
it will be possible to inject and configure a given block id.


```yml
structure:

  # declare import a base
  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml
  - import: jQuery:/register.yml
    # re-configure body_content and
    # and call a block injectable template
    body_content:
      set_template: Welcome:/templates/injected-block.php
      # using default_data, set a default injected block_id
      set_default_data:
        injected_block_id: injected_block

    # defines the configuration of the injected block
    injected_block:
        set_template: Module:/file/path.ext

    # For the fun!
    ajaxify:
      id: injected_block
```
