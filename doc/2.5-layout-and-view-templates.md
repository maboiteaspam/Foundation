## Working with templates

Templates are the implementation files of each block's' view.

They are located under `src/templates/`,
they use `plain php` as templating engine
and receives `plain php object` as data.

Views are provided an useful context helper to
realize most common display actions.

A view example is

__File:__ src/templates/hello-the-world.php
```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
?>
<h1><?php echo $this->upper($this->trans("welcome")); ?></h1>

<?php $this->display('block_to_configure'); ?>
```

    For a complete reference of available helpers

__Tips__
Don't forget to use php comments to qualify `$this` variable.

Doing so helps your IDE to provide more pertinent information!

```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
?>
... put the content here
```
