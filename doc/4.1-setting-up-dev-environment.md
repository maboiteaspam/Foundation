## Setting up DEV environment

So, you don t have enough, you want to have more, rewrite a piece of code ?

To do that in best experience possible, we ll review the steps
to setup and use an environment to develop C core modules.

##### Folder structure

To setup a dev environment, you ll need to setup
a folder with a recommended structure.

The folder should look like this

```sh
myWorkFolder/
    C/
        Foundation/
        Booststrap/
        Welcome/
    YourModule/
        vendor/
        ...
```

The next step is to open your module in a command line,
and make use `c2-bin` to `link` core modules to your `vendor` folder.

```sh
shell > c2-bin link -p=..\C\Foundation
Running "link" task
>> overwriting dependency c/foundation:dev-master to dev-master
>> Setting up folder vendor/c/foundation

All done!
>> Don't forget to run composer update

  php composer.phar update

Done, without errors.
```

Then repeat this step foreach core module to link.

```sh
shell > c2-bin link -p=..\C\Foundation
shell > c2-bin link -p=..\C\Bootstrap
shell > c2-bin link -p=..\C\Welcome
```

#### That s it !

Remote modules are linked to your vendor,
you can work on them and see immediate results of your changes.

__Tips__

Links are a special file system object.
They create link between a remote folder and a local path.

Under `unix` friendly system we use `symlink` function.

For `windows` system, we use `JUNCTION` function.
