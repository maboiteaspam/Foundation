## Working with Forms

The C framework offer you to enhance your capabilities to create
and define views by creating form as descriptive structure.

To create a form, start a new layout file,
and make use of `create_form` or `import_form` keyword.

To import a form, you should create a `yml` file under `src/forms/`.

#### Block actions

###### create_form

`create_form` keyword to create and configure a Form object to inject in the view.

It takes an array configuring the form.

```yml
structure:

  [block_id]:
    create_form:

```

###### import_form
`import_form` keyword to create and configure a Form object to inject in the view.

It takes an array configuring the form.

```yml
structure:

  [block_id]:
    import_form:
      as: myForm
      from: Welcome:/demoForm.yml
```

It then takes a number of keywords and structure to configure and
establish the form information.


#### Demonstration

__File:__ src/forms/demoForm.yml

```yml
# Each form must have a name,
# it s the alias used by others to manipulate/use the form object.
name: myForm
# It is possible to use a class defined form
# it can inject its own validation constraint,
# its own configuration.
type: \C\Welcome\FormDemo
# the HTML attributes of the HTML <form> node.
attr:
    # This attribute it useful to disable html5 validation and thus ease testing of backend validation
    novalidate: novalidate
    # set a regular attribute on the form element
    id: myForm

# Declare the members of the form under children key.
children:
  # An text field type
  # http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/text.html
  form_elment_name:
    type: text
    validation:
      - NotBlank: ~
    options:
      label: Your name
      data: John

  # A submit button
  subscribe:
    type: submit
    options:
      label: subscribe

```


Then declare the layout file to import the form object.

__File:__ src/layouts/formDemo.yml

```yml

structure:
  # let's use some pre defined structure for us.
  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml

   # The form framework requires some view helpers.
  - import: jQuery:/register.yml
  - import: Form:/register.yml

    # lets update the body_content block.
    # It will be used to display the formDemo.
    body_content:

      # This view expects to receive a form object as $myForm.
      # It will demonstrate the atuomatic rendering result of a form object.
      set_template: Welcome:/formDemo.php # This view will receive a form object and process it for rendering.

      # inject asset requirements
      require:
        # so far it s using jquery
        - jquery:2.x || 1.x
        # and needs some helpers to
        # manage errors display,
        # perform ajax validation
        - form-helper:1.x

      # Now import a form and defines its elements.
      import_form:
        as: myForm
        from: Welcome:/demoForm.yml

```

Finally, in the view you can process the form like this

__File:__ src/templates/formDemo.yml
```php
<?php
/* @var $this \C\View\ConcreteContext */
/* @var $myForm \Symfony\Component\Form\FormView This is the form object to render. */
?>

<h1>Form demonstration</h1>

<?php
echo $this->form_start($myForm);
echo $this->form_rows($myForm);
echo $this->form_end($myForm);
?>


<?php $this->inlineTo('last'); ?>
<script>
    (function () {
        var form = $("#myForm");
        form.ajaxForm({
            dataType: 'json',
            success: window.CHelpers.formErrorProcessor(form)
        });
        form.on('reset', function () {
            form.find('.errors').remove()
        })
    })();
</script>
<?php $this->endInline(); ?>

```

__Tips__
View provides a handful way to inline scripts and css to specific blocks.

You can use on of `['first','head','foot','last',]` inline asset target block.

```php
<?php $this->inlineTo('last'); ?>
<!-- put script / or css here -->
<?php $this->endInline(); ?>
```
