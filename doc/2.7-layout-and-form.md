## Working with Forms

The C framework offer you to enhance your capabilities to create
and define views by creating form as descriptive structure.

To create a form, start a new layout file,
and make use of `create_form` keyword.


`create_form` keyword to create and configure a Form object to inject in the view.

It takes an array configuring the form.

```yml
structure:

  [block_id]:
    create_form:

```

It then takes a number of keywords and structure to configure and
establish the form information.

```yml

structure:
  # let's use some pre defined structure for us.
  - import: HTML:/1-column.yml

   # The form framework requires some view helpers.
  - import: jQuery:/register.yml
  - import: Form:/register.yml

    # lets update the body_content block.
    # It will be used to display the formDemo.
    body_content:

      # This view expects to receive a form object as $myForm.
      # It will demonstrate the atuomatic rendering result of a form object.
      set_template: Welcome:/formDemo.php # This view will receive a form object and process it for rendering.

      # inject asset requirements
      require:
        # so far it s using jquery
        - jquery:2.x || 1.x
        # and needs some helpers to
        # manage errors display,
        # perform ajax validation
        - form-helper:1.x

      # Now crete a form and defines its elements.
      create_form:
        # Each form must have a name,
        # it s the alias used by others to manipulate/use the form object.
        name: myForm
        # It is possible to use a class defined form
        # it can inject its own validation constraint,
        # its own configuration.
        type: \C\Welcome\FormDemo
        # the HTML attributes of the HTML <form> node.
        attr:
            # This attribute it useful to disable html5 validation and thus ease testing of backend validation
            novalidate: novalidate
            # set a regular attribute on the form element
            id: myForm

        # Declare the members of the form under children key.
        children:
          # An text field type
          # http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/text.html
          form_elment_name:
            type: text
            validation:
              - NotBlank: ~
            options:
              label: Your name
              data: John

          # A submit button
          subscribe:
            type: submit
            options:
              label: subscribe

```
