## Working with request facets

Request facets are request selector based on facet attributes.

Facet attributes can be such as

- __device type__: desktop, mobile, tablet
- __request kind__: any, ajax, esi-master, esi-slave
- __request language__: put locale here
- __request date__: put a period here

When working with layouts, request facets
are expressed as layout transform switcher.

Within the flow of the layout definition,
the requests facets are invoked to specify
under which criterion of the request
the layout object should be transformed.

When the given request
does not match the provided criterion
the transformations are voided
and does not affect the layout object.

#### Structural actions

###### for_facets

`for_facets` keyword to conditionally transform the underlying layout object.

It takes an array of `facet=>requirement`,
they must all satisfy the given request to trigger the transform.

They can be negated using `!`.
It must be prepended to the `requirement` value.

```yml
structure:

  - for_facets:
      device: mobile
    [block_id]:
      body: Hello, this is the layout for mobile devices !!

  - for_facets:
      device: !mobile
    [block_id]:
      body: Hello, this is all none mobile devices !!
```
