# Working with layouts

Hi there! In this `README` we ll be covering
the `layout first` approach a C application let you put in action.

We ll review the concepts of layout, block, view.

We ll also review their components implementation
such as asset, form, dashboard.

## Introduction

Layout files are an important aspect of this project.
They let you control and take power on the appearance
of the rendering output of your application.

C encourage you to take the `layout first` approach,
the most quickest way to implement
a functional prototype of your application.

Once your prototype is finalized, you ll be able
to consume the layout as a the backbone of communication
between controller and frontend development.

In order to let both concern work on their own
but still communicate in a comprehensible way
the system encourage the principle and use of
__progressive layout enhancement__.

In order of declaration,
starting from the backend controller,
continued by imported frontend layout files,
if offers to progressively build and enhance the layout
of new features and behaviors.

Ok, lets make a drawing :p

It describes the page to render as a tree of named block.
```
    VISUAL                  TREE
    __________________
    |   HEADER       |      | Root
    |________________|      | Root/HEADER
    |         |      |      | Root/MAIN
    |  MAIN   |  RB  |      | Root/RB
    |         |      |      | Root/FOOTER
    |_________|______|
    |   FOOTER       |
    |________________|
```
It has a root block, and many sub blocks.

Each block can render its part
of the layout by invoking other blocks.

__Each block id is unique within the layout__

Each block hold information such template file,
assets attached to it, data to inject into the view,
meta information.


It s using a simple but powerful syntax written with `yml`

`Hello The World` example

__File:__ src/layouts/hello-the-world.yml
```yml
meta:
    id: hello-the-world
    description: Hello the world written with a layout

structure:
    - import: HTML:/1-column.yml
      body_content:
        body: |
            Hello the world !
```

the same `hello the world` example with comments

__File:__ src/layouts/hello-the-world.yml
```yml

# provide information about the layout to be rendered
meta:
    id: hello-the-world
    description: Hello the world written with a layout

# describe and update the structure of the layout
structure:

    # Import a base layout which provides supports
    # for commons task regarding an HTMl website
    # HTML is a core module to provide such fundamentals.
    - import: HTML:/1-column.yml

      # select body_content node of the layout
      # body_content was delared by HTML:/1-column.yml
      body_content:
        # set its body
        body: |
            Hello the world !
```

##### Block role and structure

It s really about describing all of the components
 of a page via a layout object.
For that matter each block of the layout
holds information
about its template, assets and so son.
The later they are resolved into plain html text,
or other structure depending the desired action.

The internal block data structure looks likes this
```yml
id: root
body: '<div>...' # the content body as plain html
options:
    template: 'HTML:/html.php' # the template path
data: {
       # .. A lits of displayed block
       # with their status of display
}
assets: {
        # .. A lits of assets block
        # to be injected in order to render this block
}
inline: {
        # .. A lits of inline assets content
        # to be injected in order to render this block
}
requires: {
       #  .. A lits of assets requirements
        # based on semver pattern
}
meta:
        # .. A handful list of meta information
        # injected by the various components
        # involved during the process
        # of building the layout
    debug_with: comments # .. this will enable dashboard debug with html comments
    from: false # .. this a raw value
    etag: '' # .. this is injected for etag computation
displayed_blocks:
        # .. A lits of displayed block
        # with their status of display
    - { id: html_begin, shown: true }
stack:
        # .. when debug is enabled,
        # this gives stack trace values
        # of caller which updated the block
    - { file: .../src/C/Layout/Layout.php, line: 390, function: getStackTrace, class: C\Misc\Utils, type: '::' }
firstAssets: {
        # .. A lits of asset paths
        # to display first
}

```

We ll see next the features the framework offer to enrich layout and blocks.

##### Layout file structure

The layout file takes root nodes

```yml
meta:
    # describe the layout object properties
structure:
    # describe the layout content structure
```

The `meta:` node takes an array of property nodes.

```yml
meta:
    id: layout-id
    description: description
```

The `structure:` node takes an array of action nodes.

```yml
structure:
    - action_node1
    - action_node2
      action_node3
      action_node4
```

Each action node can describe either
a structural change or select a block.

```yml
structure:
    - change_layout: [arguments]
    - change_layout2: [arguments]
      [block_id1]: [arguments]
      [block_id2]: [arguments]
```

When a block is selected, it is then possible
to apply it a series of block action nodes.

```yml
structure:
    - change_layout: [arguments]
    - change_layout2: [arguments]
      [block_id1]:
        set_template: /some/file.php
      [block_id2]:
        set_data: {some_data: "indeed"}
```
